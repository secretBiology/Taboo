    <string name="howtoplay_1"><b>Step 1</b>: Gather a few friends, the more the merrier :)\n\n<b>Step 2</b>: Make 2 teams.\n\n<b>Step 3</b>: A person from team 1 will start the
        game by pressing \'start game\'. Start with standard settings for now.\n\n<b>Step 4</b>: He/she will see 6 words on the screen. One in bold colors at the top and other 5 below it.
        \n\n<b>Step 5</b> : He/she should describe the word in bold to the team without using the 5 words mentioned below. Any action or signs are prohibited. These 5 words are called
        \"<b>Taboo words</b>\" :D\n\n<b>Step 6</b>: Now the team has to guess maximum number of words within the given time. When time is over, person passes the app to next team and the cycle continues till you finish all rounds.\n\n<b>Step 7</b>: One can skip
        any word if he/she wants. If person uses any of \"taboo\" words, he/she has to press \'taboo\' which will invite some penalty and next word will pop up on the screen\n\n<b>Step 8</b>: You can be as creative as you want. Imagination is the limit. Happy tabooing :)</string>
